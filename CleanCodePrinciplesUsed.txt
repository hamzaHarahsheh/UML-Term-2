4- Be consistant with naming "UserData, UserPassword, UserConfigiration"
5- Don't write methods that depends on some other things in the class
6- Use searchable names
7- Use meaningful distinction
8- "A long variable name is better than a comment"
9- Declare variables close to their usage
10- Don't break indentation
11- A method should do one thing and one thing onlyk
